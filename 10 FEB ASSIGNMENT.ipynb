    "The close() function is used in Python to close an open file. When a file is opened using the open() function, it creates a file object and opens a connection between the file and the program. After the file is used, it is essential to close the connection using the close() function.\n",
    "\n",

    "Closing a file using the close() function ensures that any data that is still in the buffer is written to the file, and the resources used by the file are freed. By releasing the resources used by the file, it also ensures that the file can be accessed by other programs or processes.\n",

    "In addition to using the close() function, it is good practice to open a file using a with statement. The with statement ensures that the file is closed automatically after it is used. For example:"
